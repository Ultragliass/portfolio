# React Vite

This project it a clean slate of **React** and **Vite** (and **Typescript**)! It was created to ensure a clean slate, with production ready features such as properly configured **eslint**, using **Vite** and **SWC** for a faster development experience and hot reloads. **Vite** also uses **Rollup** as a bundler, which is much more efficient than standard **Webpack**.
